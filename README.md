HiddenSingleton
===============

A new way to implement singleton

- we may introduce a ARC based singlton object -> object have a core obj and shell obj
- user alloc and use shell obj whenever they want
- core obj is a singleton object which can be dismissed by persiste its data into file/db and re-generated by loading its data from file/db
- whenever there is a shell object exists, core obj shall be loaded and exist by singleton in the memory
- if all the shell objects is released, core obj shall be dismissed and it's data shall be 
- 

Code is as presented, just an idea for your inspiration, I havn't verified it yet.
